		<p>Patrick J. Purcell announced today that the media company with its flagship Boston Herald tabloid has reached an agreement with GateHouse Media, LLC for them to acquire the company's operational assets. The purchase is subject to court approval.

The announcement came this afternoon as Purcell gathered management and staff in the Herald newspaper's offices on Fargo Street in Boston's Seaport District. He spoke first with his long-time management team and immediately following with staff from across all departments.

In a simultaneous letter to employees, Purcell wrote: "I am very proud of the spectacular management team with whom I have worked hand in hand over the years. And I am equally as proud of the excellent staff in all areas of our company who have worked tirelessly to make the Boston Herald a relevant and respected provider of local and regional news for Boston and the area.

"Boston is a better city for the Herald's unique and fearless local reporting. Because of all of you, we are well known for our influential political, community, business and sports coverage across the region and beyond."

The Herald (BHI), hindered like many other newspapers with significant pension and retirement liabilities as well as declining revenue with the onset of digital media and a growing variety of news originators and aggregators, had some 900 employees at its peak in 2000. Today it has 240; more than 120 of them work in the newsroom.

BHI filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition today in the District of Delaware to maximize the value of the company and its assets by selling the business as a going concern under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court.

The company contemplates that the sale will allow the operation to continue, providing the greatest stability for employees, customers and vendors; as well as the best return to unsecured creditors.
